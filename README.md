# HRV Evaluation Tool
The HRV Evalution Tool is a tool used to evaluate and visualize heart rate variability parameters using Kubios HRV Premium analysis software. The tool was developed as part of the student research project of the computer science program at DHBW Stuttgart and is used in a pilot study in the field of stress regulation capacity of the human heart.

The goal of the student research project is the conception and implementation of an interface,
which allows the automation of the processing and evaluation of the measurement data.
For this purpose, an application is to be created that links to the already used and established software Kubios HRV Premium and extends its functions. Thus, the raw data of the measurements will be imported into Kubios and the export files and their heart parameters will be graphically displayed within an application.
The focus is on the automatic generation of the samples that can be created in Kubios, which enables the division of the measurement into smaller time ranges, as well as the technically correct display of the heart parameters in the diagram to support the study. In addition, it should be possible to highlight the load interval and save the visualization as an image. 
## Installation
The tool can be installed by downloading the respective installer file. Currently there is an implementation for Windows and macOS:

 - [Windows](https://github.com/jonakr/HRVEvaluationTool/tree/main/installer/windows/HRVEvaluationTool/for_redistribution)
 - [macOS](https://github.com/jonakr/HRVEvaluationTool/tree/main/installer/macOS/HRVEvaluationTool/for_redistribution)

A more detailed installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/jonakr/HRVEvaluationTool/tree/main/docs)

## Usage and Example
For a detailed usage guide please check the [user's guide](https://github.com/jonakr/HRVEvaluationTool/tree/main/docs) . Inside the [example_data](https://github.com/jonakr/HRVEvaluationTool/tree/main/example_data) folder you can also find an example mat-file to try your first visualisation. If everything works correctly it should look like this:
